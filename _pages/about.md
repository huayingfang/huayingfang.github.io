I received my PhD in Probability and Statistics from Peking University in 2016. From 2016 to 2020, I was a postdoctoral fellow in Tang lab in Department of Genetics at Stanford University. I joined the Capital Normal University in late 2020.  My research interests lie at the interdisciplinary area of bioinformatics, statistics and genetics, using statistical methods and computational tools to address important biological questions from genomic and biomedical data. My research philosophy is grounded in advancing fundamental knowledge to solve statistical challenges in modern biology. My lab studies how genetics and the environment influence human traits from multi-omics data and worldwide biobanks.
